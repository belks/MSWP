\section{Synopsis}
\label{sect:synopsis}
\subsection{The Project Idea:}
WaveMeIn is a research project to create a new type of secure login mechanism based on brain waves. 

At the time of this proposal the most used ways for authentication are manually typed passwords or biometric authentication methods. However all of the previous methods have some security problems or are simply not user-friendly. Typed passwords are easy to spy out simply by looking at the keyboard of the user or the traces of the fingers on touch displays. In the case of biometric authentication, there are for example face recognition, iris or fingerprint scans. Face recognition software can easily be tricked by face masks or photographs and moreover depends on good light conditions, the quality of the images of the web camera and other factors. Fingerprint and iris scans are the most secure options of the authentication methods mentioned before. However they also have many disadvantages. Iris scans are not practical since the hardware required cannot easily be integrated into small devices and it is not user-friendly to require the user to place his eye very close to the scanner every time he/she wants to unlock a device. Fingerprint sensors are known to fail to recognize the fingerprint correctly quite often and it is also a not very user-friendly authentication method for handicapped people that may not reach the sensor or may not have any fingers at all. 

Brain waves are a secure and user-friendly alternative authentication method. The idea is to create a small device, called Wavy, that can be worn at the ear of the user in the same style as bluetooth headsets are already worn for communication today. The Wavy measures the brain waves near the ear in case a login is required by a client device that is connected via bluetooth. It listens for a brain wave pattern that was previously trained by the user as a password. If the correct pattern was detected by the Wavy it transmits a OK signal back to the client device. 

\subsection{Why should somebody care?}
Nowadays people are forced to type their passwords in public places which is a security risk and also not a very efficient way for authentication. Especially when typing in password on small devices such as mobile phones this authentication method is also very error prone due to the small keyboard interfaces. On the one side people are lazy and do not want to remember and enter long and complicated passwords, but on the other side they are also concerned about the security of their data and their privacy. So the users are in need of a more secure and easier way of authentication.

\subsection{Who are the beneficiaries of the results?}
Basically everybody can benefit from the WaveMeIn project since it is usable in the daily life. Especially for handicapped people it is a new and more easy to use option to log into their devices. Also it grants a higher level of security than existing authentication methods so it is also well suited for environments where higher security is needed, such as access authentication is modern research labs and government or military facilities.

For our product to succeed, we need to invest into research in the area of brain wave detection and analysis. This investment can improve our understanding of this topic. After a commercial success, we have to enhance our product. This means we have to invest further into brain wave research. On the other side, we can make our world more secure. It makes hacking of accounts and password fraud more complicated.

\subsection{Problem classification}
The task of detecting brain waves it tightly connected to the research areas of Neuroscience, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. In the field of Neuroscience it touches the areas of not invasive brain computer interfaces and neural oscillation. Since detecting and reliably identifying brain waves at the location near the ears is still technically immature the project can be seen as basic research in this area. The following research questions have to be answered before a prototype can be developed.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Detecting braves at the ears
	\item Recognize brain wave patters
	\item Distinguish correct patterns from random signals
	\item Distinguish brain waves from different users
\end{itemize}
On the other hand if we take the Wavy into account, which should be the resulting product, this project is also an applied research project. It further touches the fields of computer security and privacy.

\item Justification for the personnel and non-personnel costs (equipment, material, travel and other costs)
\item An Excel template is provided as supplementary material to support budgeting.
\item Personnel costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Justification for the personnel to be assigned to the project (type of position(s), description of nature of work, length and extent of involvement in the project)
	\item     The application should include all persons who will be required for the proposed project (project lead, researchers, developers, advisory board, etc.). The available legal categories of employment are contracts of employment for full- or part-time employees (DV) and reimbursement for work on an hourly basis (GB). In addition, a part-time contract of employment (DV 50\%, ``studentische Mitarbeiter'') may be requested for people who have not yet completed a Master or Diploma program (Diplom) in the relevant subject.
	 \item    The justification of the requested personnel should contain:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item 	        description of type of work;
		\item 		        extent of involvement (part-time contracts are permitted).
		\end{itemize}
	\item Exact numbers of employment categories can be found on the FWF Website (\href{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/projects/personalkostensaetze.html}{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/projects/personalkostensaetze.html})
	\end{itemize}
\item Equipment costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Indicate reasons for equipment costs. The ``scientific equipment'' category includes instruments, system components, costs for the use of software required by the project and other durable goods provided the cost per item (including VAT) exceeds EUR 1,500.00.
	\end{itemize}
\item Material costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     This category encompasses consumables and smaller pieces of equipment where the cost per item is below EUR 1,500.00 including VAT. The calculation of requested material costs should be justified with reference to the schedule, work plan and experimental plan. Experience with previous projects should be taken into account.
	\end{itemize}
\item Travel costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Funding may be requested for the costs of project-specific travel and accommodation, field work, expeditions, etc. Applicants are to provide a detailed travel (cost) plan broken down by project participant. For brief stays, the calculation of the travel and accommodation costs should be based on the federal regulations governing travel costs (RGV). The RGV rates governing Austria and abroad may be found in the FAQs on the FWF Website (\href{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/faq/reisegebuehrenvorschrift.html}{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/faq/reisegebuehrenvorschrift.html}). For longer stays an appropriate and comprehensible cost plan should be prepared.
	\end{itemize}
\item Other costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Independent contracts for work and services (costs for work of clearly defined scope and content assigned to individuals, provided that this is scientifically justifiable and economical)
    	\item     Costs that cannot be included under personnel, equipment, material or travel costs, such as:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item         reimbursement of costs towards or for the use of research facilities, e.g. of large-scale research facilities (project-specific 'equipment time'). Applicants should obtain and submit multiple offers;
		\item         costs for project-specific work carried out outside the applicant's research institution (e.g. for analysis work performed elsewhere, for interviews, for sample collection, for preparation of thin slices etc.). Applicants should obtain and submit multiple offers;
		\item         honoraria for test persons;
		\end{itemize}
