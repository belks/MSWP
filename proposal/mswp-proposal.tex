\section{Introduction and problem description}
\label{sect:intro}
WaveMeIn is a research project to show the potential of brain waves a new method of electronic authentication via a small wearable device. Its aim is to investigate the usage of rain waves to replace passwords or other authentication methods. Therefore the properties of brain waves regarding uniqueness and reliability have to be explored. The project shall demonstrate via a small prototype that the recognition is possible without large sensors on top of the users head. A requirement for such a method of authentication clearly exists as demonstrated by the following use cases:

\subsection{Current Situation}


\subsection{Use Case 1}{
Assume a user needs to log on to a device (e.g. a notebook) that contains sensitive information in public. Typing in the password is not an option as it can easily be monitored by another person. Fingerprints are also not a good alternative as they can easily be taken from any surface the user touched and be copied onto synthetic materials to deceive the fingerprint reader. Brain waves are (as of current knowledge) unique for each person even if two people are having exactly the same thought. If the intruder does not know the precise brain wave pattern of the user's pass phrase/thought it is impossible to duplicate.}

\subsection{Use Case 2}{
Assume an average user wants to unlock his/her smart phone in a crowded area such as the subway. Nowadays this is done by entering a pin or drawing a pattern on the screen. A person with the intention to steal a users phone just needs to observe its victim while entering the pass code or pattern. Afterwards it is easy to unlock the phone and steal the victims personal data or cause large costs while using it for phone calls and mobile data. Locking the phone via a brain wave authentication mechanism may not prevent the theft but the costs arising from the phone being used afterwards.}

\subsection{Current Authentication Methods}
In theory brain waves will be rank among the most secure authentication methods, probably being the most secure one if the research proves successful. The particular brain wave of a user required to unlock a device can not be easily be obtained other than strapping the user to a chair and forcing him/her to think his/her pass thought. Other authentication methods are password, drawing patterns, fingerprint, iris scan, voice recognition. Passwords and pattern drawing are the least secure ones as the user can be observed while typing or drawing without much effort. Fingerprint, iris scan, voice recognition may require more technical or social effort to obtain, but in the end all of them are features of a person that are always visible for the outside world and therefore copyable with more or less effort.

\subsection{Unresolved Problems and Opportunities}
The unknown factor of this research project is that no research has been done on measuring brain waves at other locations (e.g. the ears) of the body except directly at the users head. Additionally it is unknown if the brain waves of are person are distinctive enough to distinguish a pass thought of a user from other thoughts and if the brain waves of different users while thinking the same thought are distinctive enough.

At the time of writing this proposal there exists no device that is capable of the features mentioned above as well as being small enough to be worn as an accessory. Therefore this is an important area of research with practical future applications.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How can the required hardware be minimized to be small and practical (Wavy Device)?

\begin{itemize}
	\item The detection of brain waves is possible at different locations of the body.
	\item The same thought produces a repeatable and reliable brainwave pattern. (Reliability)
	\item Different people have different patterns when thinking the same thought. (Uniqueness)
	\item Brain waves can be used as authentication method.
	\item The necessary can e integrated into a small device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No mind reading device
	\item No client software (just the brain wave research, hardware and interface)
	\item No design or usability study (just a prototype that works and is small enough)
	\item No end-user/consumer product (just a prototype)
\end{itemize}

\section{State of the art / current knowledge}
\label{sect:star}
\subsection{What results and approaches have already been presented in this or related areas?}
\chapter{1. Berkeley researches replace passwords by measuring brainwaves as a biometric identifier}
\href{http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~chuang/pubs/usec13.pdf}
The US Berkeley represents an approach, which turns the brain activity of an user into a biometric identifier. To do this, the Berkeley researchers use a 100 dollar commercial EEG (electroencephalogram), which resembles a Bluetooth headseat with an electrode. This electrode is placed on the users forehead, over the brain's left frontal lobe. The electrode measures the users brainwaves and transmits them via a Bluetooth link to a Device. According to the Berkeley researchers this system has an error rate of below 1 percent.

To ensure that the brain waves of every single person are unique and that they provide enough information to authenticate the user's identity, the Berkley researchers performed tests with participants, which included different kind of tasks. For example, the participants where asked to just sit and focus on breathing in and out, imagine moving their finger up and down and listen for an audio tone. The participants where also asked to focus on a personalized secret, such as singing a song of their choice. During this tasks, the participants where wearing the EEG which measured their brain waves. As result came out, that not only the measured brainwaves of personalized secrets, but also measured brainwaves of simple tasks, like sitting and focusing on breathing, provided a pattern which makes it possible to authenticate an identity.

\chapter{2. Using Brain Waves as New Biometric Feature for Authenticating a Computer User in Real Time}
\href{http://www.cscjournals.org/manuscript/Journals/IJBB/volume7/Issue1/IJBB-211.pdf}
Using brain waves as a biometric Feature for Authenticating was proposed by Kusuma Mohanchandra, Lingaraju G M, Prashanth Kambli \& Vinay in the International Journal of Biometrics and Bioinformat. In this work it has been proved that the brain-wave pattern of every individual is  unique and the signals captured through the  EEG can be used for biometric authentication. This research team used an EEG EPOC headset with 14 channels to measure the brain waves. The collected data, containing the fusion of delta, alpha, theta, beta and gama brain waves, was merged with the aim to create a way to authenticate the user.

There are three basic forms of authentication; something-you-have, something-you-know, and something-you-are.
\begin{itemize}
\item Something-you-have can be objects like a key or passport and people have to be very careful not to loose the object or get it stolen.
\item Something-you-know is based on secret knowledge like passwords or PIN codes and the secret must never be written down, forgotten, or told to others.
\item Something-you-are involves person specific features like fingerprints, voice, face, and gait. Authentication based on such features is called biometric authentication. Brain wave based authentication is a combination of something-you-know and something-you-are when the person involved has to think about something specific, but it can also be just something-you-are when the brain waves are used directly as a biometric.
\end{itemize}
 
The most important part of any authentication system is that true identities (clients) are verified and that false identities (impostors) are rejected. In a password system the password is either right or wrong, but with biometric authentication there is an uncertainty involved because the equipment that  measure the biometric feature rarely provide exactly the same data twice. The reason is that external parameters like finger placement, head rotation, facial hair, location etc are present. The challenge is to overcome these problems in such a way that even two slightly different sets of data can be verified to originate from the same person. There is usually a threshold that decide how different
two different sets of data is allowed to be before they are rejected, and as a consequence there is a chance that some clients are falsely rejected and some impostors are falsely verified.
Biometric authentication therefore introduce two error rates; False Non-Match Rate (FNMR), the rate at which clients are falsely rejected by the system, and False Match Rate (FMR), the rate at which impostors are falsely verified by the system. As such the main problem in this thesis is two compare two or more EEG signals and decide whether they are from the same person or not, and get as low FNMR and FMR as possible.

\chapter{3. Google Glass hack allows brainwave control}


\subsection{Relation to the international scientific work in the field (international status of the research)}
The brain consists of billions of brain cells called neurons. This neurons have to communicate with each other. For this communication the neurons use electricity called brain waves. This communication is producing a lot of brain waves, which can be detected using sensible sensors such as an EEG. The first person, who confirm the existence of brain waves and perform the first tests was Hans Berger. There are five different kinds of brain waves and all of them are directly connected to what a person is thinking, doing and feeling.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Gamma (27 Hz and up)
 \item Beta (12 Hz - 27 Hz)
 \item Alpha (8 Hz - 12 Hz)
 \item Theta (3 Hz - 8 Hz)
 \item Delta (0.2 Hz - 3 Hz)
\end{itemize}

The very beginning of the existence of brain wave based authentication systems dates back to the 1960's when Vogel discovered a connection between a person's EEG signals and his/her genetic code(DNA). It was proved that every person owns unique brainwaves and it possible to identify a person through his brainwaves. Identical twins where shown to have the same EEG patterns in the same situations and even changes related to aging were similar. 


This was also explored by Benedicenti L., Koles’ Z., Mahovsky J., \& Paranjape, R. in the year 2001. This researchers used EEG directly as a biometric and their work showed some promising results on this field.


EEG based person authentication was first proposed by Marcel and Millan in 2007 in “Person authentication using brainwaves (EEG) and maximum a posteriori model adaption”. They proposed the use of  Power Spectral Density as the feature, and a statistical framework based on Gaussian Mixture  Models (GMM) and Maximum A Posteriori Model (MAP) Adaptation on speaker and face  authentication. The potential of their method is shown by simulations using strict train/test protocols and results. 

In 2001 Poulos, Alexandris and Evangelou performed person identification based on spectral information and presented their results in their work: “On the use of EEG features towards oersin identification via neural networks”. To prove the connection between a person's EEG and genetically specific information, this researchers did experiments with the EEG data of healthy individuals. The proposed method has had a success rate of 80 percent to 100 percent showing that the EEG holds genetic information, which can be used for person identification.


Furthermore, a novel two-stage biometric authentication method was proposed by Palaniappan in 2008 (“Two-stage biometric authentication method using thought activity brain waves”). Their results show that the combination of two-stage authentication with EEG features has good potential as a biometric as it is highly resistant to fraud.

\subsection{Description and critical discussion of related scientific work}
The approaches that have been discussed above have succeeded to prove the connection between a person's DNA and her/his brain waves. The approaches clearly show that every single person possesses unique brain waves, which can be used to identify a person. However, a large disadvantage of all of this approaches is that they require the user to wear a big headset with an electrode going across his/her forehead. None of this approaches has succeeded in measuring brain waves from different body parts in order to enable a smaller headset and therefore make it easier for the user to use it in their everyday life.
